- 👋 Hi, I’m @zulucomputer
- 👀 I’m interested in deep learning, anomaly detection, predictive analytics, uncertainty quatification, explainable AI, computer vision and more.
- 🌱 I hold a Ph.d. in Data Science and Machine Learning from the school of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate on any interesting data-related projects! My time is currently occupied with using A.I. to solve complex problems unique to financial institutions, and I serve as the Head of Strategic Analytics at one of the big four banks in South Africa. Prior to that, I was the Lead Data Scientist at Africa's largest fintech.
- 📫 How to reach me: shine the bat signal into the sky on a cloudy evening...
